# Monuments and Memorials 

## Project Description  
Monuments and Memorials (M+M) offers insight into a community’s values and history. It offers tribute to a person, idea, or event to honor its memory. This honor extends to an individual or group who has passed away, or in the case of veterans, killed in action. 
  
M+M is an existing website that allows people to view monuments and memorials located across the United States, found at this address: https://monuments.us.org. The M+M website contains crowdsourced data which allows anyone to view information such as when the monument or memorial was created, why it was created, and any changes in its location.  
  
This project was started in 2019 and has been worked on by two teams. The original team implemented a working UI allowing registered users to add new monuments to the site’s database. The second team allowed for the addition of temporary monuments as well as created the framework for bulk uploading and exporting of monument data. 
  
This year our team is planning on making enhancements to the site. The first enhancement is improving upon the bulk create and bulk export functionalities to simplify the processes. In addition to this, we plan on fully implementing a bulk edit feature to allow quick and easy modification of information about monuments. Lastly, we plan on adding accessibility features and making the site completely mobile supported.
